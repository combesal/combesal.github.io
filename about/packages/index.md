title: Packages and Process
description: 'Technical writing services for SaaS startups: documentation audits, developer docs, starter documentation, and maintenance retainers. Clear pricing and process.'
---

I provide technical writing services for SaaS startups and growing product teams.

My focus is on **clear, structured, user-focused documentation** that reduces support workload and frees up your developers’ time.

All projects are handled through an **umbrella company** (portage salarial), which manages invoicing, contracts, and insurance. This ensures a simple and compliant setup.

## My Process

![Project workflow: discovery, proposal, planning, drafting, review, delivery](./process.png)
*Overview of my typical workflow for technical writing projects.*

Each project typically follows these steps:

1. **Discovery Call** – Discuss goals, audience, and project scope.
2. **Proposal & Agreement** – Clear outline of deliverables, timeline, pricing, and administrative setup via umbrella company.
3. **Research & Planning** – Gather source materials, interview SMEs, and plan content structure.
4. **Drafting & Review** – Produce initial drafts, incorporate feedback, refine for clarity, usability, and accessibility.
5. **Delivery & Handoff** – Final content delivered in your preferred format, ready for integration or publication.

Timelines include built-in buffers for client feedback and SME availability. If you need a tighter schedule, we can discuss an adjusted timeline without compromising quality.
