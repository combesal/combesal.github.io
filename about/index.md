description: 'Technical writer for SaaS startups. Background in dev, translation, and support. I write documentation for global teams and non-native English speakers.'
---

**I'm a freelance technical writer who makes complex tools easier to understand.**

I specialize in clear, user-focused documentation: user guides, onboarding content, developer docs, and internal tools.

With a background in translation, web development, and IT support, I bring a cross-disciplinary perspective to every project. I pick up new tools quickly and write with global, non-native English-speaking audiences in mind.


## How I Can Help

- **Drive feature adoption** — Clear, step-by-step guides that help users understand new features immediately  
- **Reduce support tickets** — Self-service docs that answer common questions before users ask  
- **Streamline  onboarding** — Structured content that prevents tribal knowledge and brings employees up to speed faster  

## My Approach

I learn your product, collaborate with your team, and translate technical complexity into documentation users can follow immediately.

My workflow includes research, collaboration with SMEs, plain-language drafts, and iterative revisions using tools like Confluence, GitHub, and CMS platforms.

## Availability

I'm available for freelance contracts and long-term documentation projects.
