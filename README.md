# ðŸ“˜ Personal Technical Writing Portfolio

A live portfolio site and example of my documentation approach. Built to reflect the same principles I apply to every writing project: clarity, user-first navigation, and scalable content design.

This site shares:  
- My background and approach to technical writing  
- Writing samples and portfolio work  
- FAQs and a roadmap for future updates  

The goal is to create a professional, accessible space to present who I am and what I do.
