# Introduction

Welcome to **My Portfolio Project**: a hands-on demonstration of how I approach documentation.

As a freelance **technical writer**, I created this site to explore **Docusaurus**, experiment with **developer-focused tooling**, and showcase my ability to produce structured, navigable, and developer-friendly technical content.

With a background in **React** and **Markdown**, I was already comfortable with the fundamentals. This project gave me the opportunity to apply them in a real-world context — building a modern documentation site from the ground up.

Take a look around. The layout, organization, and tone are all intentional — focused on usability, clarity, and a strong developer experience.

If you're looking for a writer who can deliver concise, technically accurate documentation that integrates seamlessly into your team’s workflow — feel free to get in touch.
