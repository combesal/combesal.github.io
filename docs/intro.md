description: 'Portfolio of technical writing samples: user guides, API docs, and developer content for SaaS products. See my approach to structured, clear documentation.'

This site showcases my technical writing work and demonstrates how I think about documentation. 

I designed and built it using Docusaurus, a static site generator popular with developer teams. The goal was to create something structured, navigable, and developer-friendly—the same principles I apply to client projects.

Browse the samples, explore the structure, or read more about my process. If you're looking for a technical writer who understands developer workflows and can deliver accurate, well-organized documentation, let's talk.
