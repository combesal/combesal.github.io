# Case Study: Mini-Audit

:::info
This case study highlights my approach to reviewing documentation clarity, translation impact, and usability. This is **not based on commissioned work**; all audited pages are publicly available from Infomaniak.
:::

## Overview

**Objective**  
Show how a focused documentation audit can surface issues in clarity, structure, and translation quality. This mini-audit of Infomaniakâ€™s kDrive docs illustrates how even small documentation improvements can enhance usability, reduce support burden, and improve multilingual consistency.

**Scope**  

- Deep dive into one service: kDrive
- Light assessment of overall knowledge base information architecture (IA)
- Observations on multilingual/translation aspects (French â†’ English)

**Limitations**  
Findings are illustrative, based on publicly available content.

## Key Insights

### Â Information Architecture  

- **Observation:** Navigation was inconsistent; users could get lost in deeper levels.
- **Recommendation:** Define clear user journeys and side menus for visibility.

*Example of improved information architecture: category grouping*

### Â Content Quality

- **Observation:** Long sentences and unclear link text reduced readability.
- **Recommendation:** Rewrite with shorter sentences and clearer headings to improve clarity.

### Â User Experience (UX)

- **Observation:** Inconsistent formatting, e.g., heading hierarchy errors.
- **Recommendation:** Use consistent heading levels, bullets, and list formatting for accessibility.

### Â Multilingual

- **Observation:** English translations frequently mirror French structure too literally, and updates sometimes lag behind.
- **Recommendation:** Create a multilingual glossary and synchronization process.

## Takeaways

A documentation audit can deliver:

- **Quick wins:** standardize titles, add related links, fix formatting issues
- **Long-term improvements:** redesign IA, implement governance framework, improve multilingual workflows
- **Stronger user experience:** make content more findable, scannable, and accurate

## What I Learned

- How to apply audit frameworks to a limited-scope, real-world KB  
- Best practices for **multilingual documentation** and **translation governance**  
- Importance of using **evidence-based examples** (before/after screenshots)
