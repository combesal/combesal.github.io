# Recommendations

Here are some recommendations from colleagues I’ve worked with.  
They reflect how I approach collaboration and communication, which are also central to my work in documentation.

The documentation she created was **clear, concise, and highly professional**, greatly improving internal knowledge sharing and helping others ramp up more easily. Her contributions **brought real value** to the team, and her proactive mindset made working with her a joy.

> "I had the pleasure of working with Ali at BforeAI, and wow- she truly wore many hats!
Ali was instrumental in getting our IT support backlog under control, **bringing structure and clarity** where it was badly needed. She led daily standups with the **calm confidence** of a true servant leader and had a deep understanding of SCRUM artifacts and Agile workflows. What really stood out was her ability to bridge the gap between the engineering team and stakeholders like the Product Owner or upper management— not only with clear communication but in her technical writing. On that note, **her documentation skills are top-notch**— clear, concise, and incredibly useful. I often would send employees asking a repetitive question over to one of Ali's docs. All in all, **super organized, sharp at dissecting problems**, and just a great person to work with. Ali's the kind of teammate every team wishes they had; kind, respectful, humble & talented."
