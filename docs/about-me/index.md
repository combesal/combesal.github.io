# About Me

## 👋 Hi There

**I'm a freelance technical writer who makes complex tools easier to understand.**

✍️ I specialize in clear, user-focused documentation, including user guides, onboarding content, developer docs, and internal tools.

💡 With a background in translation, web development, and IT support, I bring a cross-disciplinary perspective to every project and pick up new tools quickly. I aim to make information clear, consistent, and accessible, especially for global and non-native English-speaking audiences.

📘 *Documentation isn’t a side note. It’s how your product speaks.*

## 🧩 How I Can Help

I help teams work more efficiently and support multilingual audiences by creating clear, practical documentation — especially for non-native English speakers.

The main ways I can help include:
- ✅ Reducing support tickets with effective self-service content  
- ✅ Streamlining employee onboarding through structured guides  
- ✅ Driving feature adoption with clear, actionable walkthroughs  

## ✍️ My Approach

I’ve developed a writing workflow that includes:

- Research and source review
- Collaborating with subject matter experts
- Drafting in plain language
- Reviewing and revising based on collaborative input
- Using and adapting to documentation tools such as Confluence, GitHub, and CMS platforms
