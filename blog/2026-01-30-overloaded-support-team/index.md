Your SaaS company is scaling fast: your Series A just closed, you've tripled your customer base in six months, and you’ve hired 20 people just to keep up. But your support team is drowning in tickets, and your documentation is either non-existent or a mess of scattered pages.

Let’s look at why your documentation isn’t scaling as fast as your business. <!-- truncate -->
There are four common ways your docs are failing. I'll walk you through each problem, show you what kind of documentation actually scales with your growth, and provide an action plan you can start implementing this week.

## The snowball effect

Maybe you’re familiar with this scenario?

* Your support team is overwhelmed.  
* Your first contact resolution rate is plummeting.  
* Your users are frustrated and impatient.  
* Everything feels like it’s spiralling out of control.

It’s not just external. Internally, your team is struggling too. Developers are constantly interrupted by repeated questions, onboarding new hires takes weeks instead of days, and knowledge is locked away in your employees’ heads, unshared.

On top of all this chaos, each ticket is costing you money to resolve. You’re now wondering if you’re able to increase the size of your support team, but user questions are multiplying faster than you can onboard new hires.

Direct costs aren't your only concern either; poor support experiences drive churn. Your small support team can't be personally available for everyone all the time, but expectations are increasingly more demanding. A [2024 HubSpot report](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/state-of-service-report) reveals that 90% of customers expect an immediate response to their questions (within 10 minutes or less), while [Zendesk’s most recent study](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com/#trend-2) shows that nearly three-quarters of consumers expect customer service to be available 24/7.

[According to HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/statistics-on-customer-retention), 67% of customer churn is preventable by resolving issues during the first interaction. When your support team is overwhelmed, first-contact resolution suffers, and customers leave.

## Self-Service: your 24/7 support team

Your users can have access to 24/7 support without needing a round-the-clock support team. According to [Zendesk's 2023 report](https://www.zendesk.com/sg/blog/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value/%20), 98% of customers use self-service online resources, with 80% often consulting these options before contacting customer service. While there will always be users who need help, self-service documentation empowers them to find solutions on their own.

[Buffer reduced support ticket volume](https://www.lotusthemes.com/blogs/best-help-centers/how-to-reduce-support-tickets-by-26-after-help-center-redesign-buffer-case-study) by using a Zendesk feature that suggests related help articles during the help request process. Redesigning their help centre reduced support tickets by 26%.

## Just ‘having documentation’ isn't enough

Documentation reduces the need for direct human input, especially for repetitive and common questions. This gives your support team more time to focus on any previously undetected issues that come up. It’s not just a case of ‘having docs’ though.

Here are four common reasons documentation fails to deliver results and ways to prevent them:

### Missing or incomplete content

Missing information means that your users only have access to help through your employees, who are handling requests about every little detail. A common mistake is documenting only the standard flow or [happy path](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/happy-path). Missing potential issues or alternative user journeys can leave your users stuck when they encounter problems.

The reality is that your support team knows these details inside out; they just haven’t been documented. A lack of maintenance workflows or an ownership system means that no one takes responsibility for updates. Or your team is too busy fighting fires to check the state of the documentation. Often, though, if your users can’t find answers, they’ll either contact support for help or just leave quietly for a product they understand better.

In contrast, including these cases in your help documentation enables and empowers your users to find answers quickly on their own. This also frees your team to focus on more complicated issues while improving customer satisfaction.

Here are some useful questions to ask when checking for gaps in your docs:

* **Focus** – Do your user guides answer real questions that your users are asking?
* **Error messages** – Do users understand why they received an error? Is a solution provided in the user interface (UI)?
* **Edge cases** – Are your docs written from the right perspective? Do they require prior knowledge? Not everyone fits in the same box. Users often use tools differently to how they are expected to, also known as [desire paths](https://thegood.com/insights/digital-desire-paths/).

### Irrelevant content

On the other hand, too much information can cause confusion for your users, especially if not everything is useful. Maintaining documentation can take time, especially if it wasn’t built for easy maintenance: no templates or standards, lack of ownership, multiple pages with conflicting information. Organising your docs with [information architecture (IA) best practices](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-information-architecture/#best-practices-for-information-architects) will help your users find the right content, and your team maintain it more easily.

This is also where knowing your audience is essential. User documentation needs to reach both beginners *and* expert users. Structuring your support content will help each user type find what they’re looking for, whether skimming for a specific topic or reading word-for-word to gain a full understanding.

Creating templates for your different documentation types enforces a set structure that guides your users. We naturally recognise patterns. When pages follow a consistent structure, our brain recognises how the elements are laid out. This eases the mental effort needed to process the information, helping us navigate faster.

Think of it like an IKEA floor layout: there’s a preset order with clear signage (and even arrows showing the expected flow\!). Whether you’re at your local store in Paris or visiting IKEA in Geneva, you know you’ll easily find the kitchenware or bedroom furniture. In the same way, users will recognise the structure in your quick start guides or troubleshooting steps, helping them find their answers more easily.

You can use these points to check if your content is relevant to users:

* **Search** – Can your users find the answers they need, or do they waste time searching? Your search tool may not be intuitive.
* **Structure** – Are your help pages structured? Does the navigation have a clear, consistent organisation for good usability?
* **Maintenance** – Who is responsible for updating documentation? Should this be assigned to an individual or a team?

### Outdated content

Let’s be honest, things move quickly, and keeping documentation current is challenging. This is especially true during rapid product development.

Integrating good documentation practices from the start helps reduce the effort for documenting new products and features. When documentation evolves alongside innovation, it becomes more than an afterthought when support tickets start flooding in.

There are many techniques that help companies keep track of changes in their documentation. Here are some examples to get you started:

* **Version control** – you don’t need a complicated setup or tech skills to track versions. Confluence, Notion and Google Docs all allow you to view a history of changes.  
* **Ownership** – Assigning who is responsible for documentation maintenance prevents it from being forgotten by establishing clear accountability.
* **Workflow integration** – An ideal time to check that documentation matches the features is when developers update the code. You can use a docs checklist before deploying code updates to keep on top of changes and new feature docs.
* **Feedback loops** – Make updates based on recurring support tickets, social media, or customer feedback forms. User input is essential for understanding their pain points.
* **Review cycles** – Scheduling regular documentation reviews will help catch outdated content. Organise a timeline that fits with your team’s availability and project needs.  
* **Docs culture** – Train all teams to make docs, not just one person or department. Provide tools like templates and guidance to encourage consistency.

### Hidden content

Documentation that no one can find is documentation that no one can use. Do you know if your users can find the information they need? If your support team is fielding questions that are already answered somewhere in your knowledge base, then it’s likely they simply can’t find them.

There could be many reasons why your users struggle to find the right answers. Documentation links might be too subtle, for example just a help link in the footer, or buried under several layers of navigation. It could be that the help pages don’t come up in the search because they aren’t relevant to the users’ search terms or are hidden behind a login or a paywall.

Here’s what you can do about this:

* **Display prominently** – Make documentation findable when it’s needed: clearly link help docs directly from your product or site. Check user access \- do your docs require authentication or a subscription? Fix any broken links.
* **Structure logically** – Categorise your documentation based on user needs: quick start guides, how-to articles, troubleshooting pages, FAQs. Avoid fragmentation by keeping the same topics together.
* **Organise clearly** –  Create intuitive navigation with clear labels, avoid nested pages, and keep menu levels to a minimum.
* **Enable search** – Being able to search makes a huge difference in helping users pinpoint the information they need faster. Add a search functionality that uses keywords your users actually use.

## Types of documentation and when to use them

Now we’ve explored what makes good documentation, we’ll look at the types of documentation that exist and how each can help support your users.

### Knowledge Base

This is a searchable collection of self-service articles, centralised in one place with structured navigation. It encompasses the different types of customer-facing documentation, such as tutorials, FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and in-app help.

A well-organised knowledge base directly addresses the problem of hidden content; everything users need is centralised and searchable.

**Impact:** A knowledge base helps reduce support volume while improving SEO, or Google search visibility (if public, not gated behind a paywall).

### Quick Start Guides

Often the first point of call for most users, these pages contain sets of brief, minimal steps required for first-time setups and configuration. They are often used during free trial periods and product onboarding.

These guides fill a critical gap in missing content. For example, many users often wonder ”Now what?” after signing up.

**Impact:** These guides can help convert prospective users into paying customers by helping them onboard easily and see value quickly.

### User Guides

From general step-by-step to advanced feature instructions, user guides cover a range of different knowledge levels. They are typically characterised by simple, active language and task-focused steps. Visuals like product screenshots are often used to help users understand context.

The task-focused nature of user guides helps users avoid irrelevant information while providing key how-to details that are often missing.

**Impact:** These guides are usually part of your users’ self-service options, helping reduce support ticket volume. They can also help prevent churn by improving user experience.

### Troubleshooting / FAQs

These problem-focused articles help users identify and solve issues quickly and independently. They often follow a set format, first presenting the problem, explaining briefly the cause and leading users in resolving this issue through logical steps. This is ideal for helping solve commonly recurring issues, which can be used before contacting support.

These docs document edge cases and errors, which are often missing in other formats. Using problem-first language also makes them easier for users to find.

**Impact:** Fast, easy-access to problem resolutions improves both user experience and product reputation.

## Taking action

This article covers many different aspects of documentation, which might feel overwhelming, especially if you’re already swamped by support tickets. Just remember, you don't need to fix everything at once: start with just one problem and work from there. And if you don’t have any documentation tools, don’t let that stop you. Start with accessible tools for now, like Google Docs, Notion or Confluence, then migrate to dedicated software as you grow, if necessary.

Below is an example action plan to strategically implement improvements to your documentation:

---

### Phase 1 (1 week)

If you’re not sure where to start, I find the best place is with your users. After all, the main aim of documentation is to improve user experience. Whether you use an Excel spreadsheet, a Jira board, or Zendesk, look through all of your customer support requests over the past 3-6 months.

**Timeframe**  
**Small teams:** 1-2 hours skimming issues to spot repetition  
**Larger teams:** 4-6 hours for greater ticket volume

---

### Phase 2 (1-2 weeks)

Categorise common or recurring issues, whether they’ve been resolved or not. This task should help you understand where your users tend to get stuck the most. Select up to three issues that are the most urgent (biggest impact for your users) or easiest to fix.

**Timeframe**  
Small teams: 2-3 hours for clear, focused docs
Larger teams: 5-8 hours, allowing for reviews and approval with company documentation standards

---

### Phase 3 (ongoing)

Monitor the impact to see how your documentation helps users. Create feedback loops and track weekly ticket trends to see if the same issues are still raised after creating docs. Find the latest, most common questions. Continue making regular improvements based on the data.

**Timeframe**  
Small teams: 1-3 hours per month  
Larger teams: 3-6 hours per month

---

### Results

Within just a few weeks of updating or creating documentation for those first three recurring issues, you should see a noticeable drop in related tickets. You’ll also find that issue resolutions are faster for these areas, and your team can benefit by referencing the docs instead of scouring through old tickets and emails for answers.

---

## Improved support scaling through documentation

Poor or non-existent documentation leads to higher user effort and confusion. These bad experiences lead to product abandonment and churn. Documentation is a key strategy to scaling your customer service options efficiently, while also improving user satisfaction.

You don’t need fancy tools or a whole team dedicated to documentation. Now you’re armed with a better understanding of what makes good documentation, various pitfalls to avoid, and an action plan for getting started.

This approach works for companies with the capacity to handle it internally. However, if your team is stretched too thin, bringing in outside help can speed up the process.
