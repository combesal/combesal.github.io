When I decided to build my technical writing portfolio, I wanted it to do more than just host samples. I wanted it to reflect how I think about documentation: **structured, clear, and built with the same tools developers use**.

<!-- truncate -->

## Choosing the Tools

I built the site with **Docusaurus**, a React-based static site generator. Since I already had experience with React and Markdown, it felt like a natural fit. The framework gave me full control over layout and structure while keeping the writing process simple and efficient.

I wanted the portfolio to work like a real documentation project: **modular, easy to update, and reader-friendly**.

## Designing the Structure

The site is organized like a typical documentation set:

- An **Introduction** to outline the project's purpose
- An **About Me** section to explain my background and writing approach
- A **Portfolio** area for samples and future projects
- A **FAQs** page built with React for interactivity and accessibility

This layout keeps navigation simple and shows how I think about structure and hierarchy, which are key parts of any documentation project.

## Building for Clarity and Usability

Docusaurus handles most of the design defaults, but I made some adjustments to improve readability and responsiveness, while adding a little of my own style. I focused on **spacing, typography, and consistent tone** across all sections.

For the FAQs, I built a small React component that allows users to filter questions by category and search by keyword. It's a compact example of how **interactivity can also support clarity**.

## Publishing the Site

The site is published via **GitHub Pages**, which keeps updates quick and version-controlled. I wanted to keep the process as close as possible to a real documentation workflow and make use of my web development background.

## What I Learned

This project reinforced how much I enjoy combining **writing, structure, and technical problem-solving**. It also reminded me that documentation is never just text: it's **design, clarity, and empathy for the reader**, all working together.
