🦸🏻‍♀️ I switched careers… but kept the cape!

They often call it “starting over”, but really it’s just a new chapter, not a whole new book.

<!-- truncate -->

Yes, the job title changed, so did the domain. 
But I didn’t show up empty-handed...

Turns out I smuggled in some superpowers, like:
- 💥 Finding clarity in the chaos
- 💥 Making things useful, not just clear
- 💥 Noticing the gaps others skip past
- 💥 Holding the big picture without losing the details

These weren’t skills I picked up from a course.
They came from years of working, observing, learning, and adapting.

In my previous role, for example, I used those strengths to stay aware of what was happening within the company, quickly finding the right information to help colleagues move forward.

So, I might look like a “junior” on paper,
but I’m definitely not a blank slate.

Career switching isn’t like pressing reset.
It’s catching a new wind in your sails, but the instincts come with you.

🚀 If you’re switching careers, remember: you’re not starting from scratch.
And don’t forget your superpowers!
