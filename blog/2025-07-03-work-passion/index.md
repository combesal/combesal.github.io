ðŸ’­ You know that quote about loving what you do and never working a day in your life?

I always thought it was just a nice idea, but recently I finally understood how it feels.

<!-- truncate -->

It made me wonder, how many of us are actually doing work we honestly enjoy, not just tolerate?

Personally, Iâ€™ve always tried to choose work that aligns with my strengths and passions, but discovering technical writing felt like stumbling onto something I didnâ€™t know I was missing.

Have you ever had a job you genuinely enjoyed, where time just flew by and you didnâ€™t want the day to end?

Well, thatâ€™s exactly how I feel about technical writing.

Iâ€™m still new to the field, but Iâ€™ve already found myself jotting down ideas at midnight and losing track of time while writing. Thatâ€™s how I know Iâ€™m in the right place.

ðŸ’¡ What kind of work makes you lose track of time?
