In this post, I share how focusing on steady, repeatable actions has helped me grow as a tech writer. Progress often comes from small steps, not perfect starts.

It’s simple, but this is the best advice I’ve received recently: **consistency beats perfection**.

It wasn’t even related to work; it was about exercising regularly. This can be applied to any area of life though: **small, consistent actions build habits** and eventually lead to meaningful results.

I’m a bit of a perfectionist. Sometimes starting is hard because I want things to be perfect or overthink the steps I need to take. Focusing on consistency rather than perfection helps me make progress, even if I don’t get it just right the first time.

## How I’m applying it

To apply this to my work as a tech writer, I’m working on making certain habits more consistent, including:

- Reviewing user guides and other documentation to see what works and what doesn’t
- Watching training videos or webinar replays regularly
- Interacting more in Slack/Discord channels
- Writing posts for LinkedIn and my blog to practise and develop my writing
- Reading tech news almost daily to stay informed

I’m just starting to make these habits stick. This post itself is part of putting consistency into action.

## What I’m learning

Over time, these small, steady steps help me strengthen key skills: understanding user needs, spotting clarity and structure in documentation, and practising concise, user-focused writing.

Progress builds gradually. You might not notice it each day, but after a month or two, the improvement becomes clear. That progress is its own reward and a reminder that steady effort pays off.

## A final thought

Finally, the key to consistency is **persistence**. Missing a day or a week isn’t a failure. What matters is always returning to your routine and continuing the work.
