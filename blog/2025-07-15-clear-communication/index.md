Recently, I found myself assembling a new barbecue that came with just a set of unclear, visual-only instructions.

As a technical writer, I’m used to creating materials that clarify complex information, but this experience reminded me just how crucial clear guidance really is… especially when it’s missing.

My husband and I have very different approaches to problem-solving. I tend to carefully analyze instructions before diving in, while he prefers to jump straight in and figure things out as he goes. With such confusing visuals, those differences became even more apparent.

This little project turned into an informal exercise in technical communication and teamwork. I helped interpret the ambiguous images, bridging the gap between unclear instructions and practical action.

It was the perfect reminder that good technical writing isn’t just about words, it’s about anticipating the different ways people understand information and making it accessible to everyone.

Whether you’re assembling a grill or writing a user manual, clear, well-tested instructions can save time, frustration, and maybe even a few extra screws.
