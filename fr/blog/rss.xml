            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🦸🏻‍♀️ I switched careers… but kept the cape!</p>
<p>They often call it “starting over”, but really it’s just a new chapter, not a whole new book.</p>
<p>Yes, the job title changed, so did the domain.
But I didn’t show up empty-handed...</p>
<p>Turns out I smuggled in some superpowers, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>💥 Finding clarity in the chaos</li>
<li>💥 Making things useful, not just clear</li>
<li>💥 Noticing the gaps others skip past</li>
<li>💥 Holding the big picture without losing the details</li>
</ul>
<p>These weren’t skills I picked up from a course.
They came from years of working, observing, learning, and adapting.</p>
<p>In my previous role, for example, I used those strengths to stay aware of what was happening within the company, quickly finding the right information to help colleagues move forward.</p>
<p>So, I might look like a “junior” on paper,
but I’m definitely not a blank slate.</p>
<p>Career switching isn’t like pressing reset.
It’s catching a new wind in your sails, but the instincts come with you.</p>
<p>🚀 If you’re switching careers, remember: you’re not starting from scratch.
And don’t forget your superpowers!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>🧭 I didn’t know where I was going, just that I had to go.</p>
<p>About four years ago, I quit my job and made a big career change.</p>
<p>In those four years, I’ve learned a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered more about myself: who I am, what I enjoy, and the kind of work that brings me energy and purpose.</p>
<p>I started by studying web development and exploring a range of technologies and tools.</p>
<p>Along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>🔍 I strengthened my research skills</li>
<li>🧠 I realised I have the ability to understand complex systems</li>
<li>🧩 I found that I really enjoy making sense of technical information</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in tech support led me into technical writing, which turned out to be the perfect fit, combining communication, curiosity and technology in a way that really suits me.</p>
<p>One of the things that drew me to working in tech in the first place is how quickly things evolve.
As a writer, I’m constantly learning — keeping up with new tools and systems, deepening my understanding, and translating it all for people who might be seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy that kind of ongoing learning.</p>
<p>Looking back on these years of transition, and the moment I took that first step into the unknown, I’d definitely make the same choice again!</p>
<p>👉 Have you made a career change, or are you thinking about it?
What have you learned through the process?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>⏳ Given the amount of time we spend at work, it's no surprise that many people seek increased fulfilment in their professional lives by changing careers.</p>
<p>My own transition into web development has been a transformative and enriching experience, so I’d say this quote sums up my career change journey pretty well.</p>
<p>Here’s a very quick insight into what I’ve been learning and how I’ve grown in the process:</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Existing Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💡 Adaptability</li>
<li>💡 Open-mindedness</li>
<li>💡 Resilience</li>
<li>💡 Creativity</li>
<li>💡 Problem solving</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developing New Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>🌱 Analytical thinking</li>
<li>🌱 Curiosity</li>
<li>🌱 Innovation</li>
<li>🌱 Leadership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expanding Horizons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>🌟 Continuous learning</li>
