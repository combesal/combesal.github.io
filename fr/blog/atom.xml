        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I built my technical writing portfolio using Docusaurus, React, and docs-as-code principles to showcase both writing and technical skills.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I decided to build my technical writing portfolio, I wanted it to do more than just host samples. I wanted it to reflect how I think about documentation: <strong>structured, clear, and built with the same tools developers use</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="choosing-the-tools">Choosing the Tools<a href="https://combesal.github.io/fr/blog/behind-the-build-portfolio#choosing-the-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Choosing the Tools" title="Lien direct vers Choosing the Tools">​</a></h2>
<p>I built the site with <strong>Docusaurus</strong>, a React-based static site generator. Since I already had experience with React and Markdown, it felt like a natural fit. The framework gave me full control over layout and structure while keeping the writing process simple and efficient.</p>
<p>I wanted the portfolio to work like a real documentation project: <strong>modular, easy to update, and reader-friendly</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="designing-the-structure">Designing the Structure<a href="https://combesal.github.io/fr/blog/behind-the-build-portfolio#designing-the-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Designing the Structure" title="Lien direct vers Designing the Structure">​</a></h2>
<p>The site is organized like a typical documentation set:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <strong>Introduction</strong> to outline the project's purpose</li>
<li>An <strong>About Me</strong> section to explain my background and writing approach</li>
<li>A <strong>Portfolio</strong> area for samples and future projects</li>
<li>A <strong>FAQs</strong> page built with React for interactivity and accessibility</li>
</ul>
<p>This layout keeps navigation simple and shows how I think about structure and hierarchy, which are key parts of any documentation project.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="building-for-clarity-and-usability">Building for Clarity and Usability<a href="https://combesal.github.io/fr/blog/behind-the-build-portfolio#building-for-clarity-and-usability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Building for Clarity and Usability" title="Lien direct vers Building for Clarity and Usability">​</a></h2>
<p>Docusaurus handles most of the design defaults, but I made some adjustments to improve readability and responsiveness, while adding a little of my own style. I focused on <strong>spacing, typography, and consistent tone</strong> across all sections.</p>
<p>For the FAQs, I built a small React component that allows users to filter questions by category and search by keyword. It's a compact example of how <strong>interactivity can also support clarity</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="publishing-the-site">Publishing the Site<a href="https://combesal.github.io/fr/blog/behind-the-build-portfolio#publishing-the-site" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers Publishing the Site" title="Lien direct vers Publishing the Site">​</a></h2>
<p>The site is published via <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, which keeps updates quick and version-controlled. I wanted to keep the process as close as possible to a real documentation workflow and make use of my web development background.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-i-learned">What I Learned<a href="https://combesal.github.io/fr/blog/behind-the-build-portfolio#what-i-learned" class="hash-link" aria-label="Lien direct vers What I Learned" title="Lien direct vers What I Learned">​</a></h2>
<p>This project reinforced how much I enjoy combining <strong>writing, structure, and technical problem-solving</strong>. It also reminded me that documentation is never just text: it's <strong>design, clarity, and empathy for the reader</strong>, all working together.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently, I found myself assembling a new barbecue that came with just a set of unclear, visual-only instructions.</p>
<p>As a technical writer, I’m used to creating materials that clarify complex information, but this experience reminded me just how crucial clear guidance really is… especially when it’s missing.</p>
<p>My husband and I have very different approaches to problem-solving. I tend to carefully analyze instructions before diving in, while he prefers to jump straight in and figure things out as he goes. With such confusing visuals, those differences became even more apparent.</p>
<p>This little project turned into an informal exercise in technical communication and teamwork. I helped interpret the ambiguous images, bridging the gap between unclear instructions and practical action.</p>
<p>It was the perfect reminder that good technical writing isn’t just about words, it’s about anticipating the different ways people understand information and making it accessible to everyone.</p>
<p>Whether you’re assembling a grill or writing a user manual, clear, well-tested instructions can save time, frustration, and maybe even a few extra screws.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This started as a series of posts, but I wanted to bring the ideas together in one place.</p>
<p>Because technical writing isn’t just documentation, instructions, or definitions.
It’s a craft built around clarity, empowerment, and trust.</p>
<p>This isn't a full definition, but here’s a short visual guide to a few things I think matter in this field.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>💭 You know that quote about loving what you do and never working a day in your life?</p>
<p>I always thought it was just a nice idea, but recently I finally understood how it feels.</p>
<p>It made me wonder, how many of us are actually doing work we honestly enjoy, not just tolerate?</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve always tried to choose work that aligns with my strengths and passions, but discovering technical writing felt like stumbling onto something I didn’t know I was missing.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a job you genuinely enjoyed, where time just flew by and you didn’t want the day to end?</p>
<p>Well, that’s exactly how I feel about technical writing.</p>
<p>I’m still new to the field, but I’ve already found myself jotting down ideas at midnight and losing track of time while writing. That’s how I know I’m in the right place.</p>
<p>💡 What kind of work makes you lose track of time?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>🦸🏻‍♀️ I switched careers… but kept the cape!</p>
<p>They often call it “starting over”, but really it’s just a new chapter, not a whole new book.</p>
<p>Yes, the job title changed, so did the domain.
But I didn’t show up empty-handed...</p>
<p>Turns out I smuggled in some superpowers, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>💥 Finding clarity in the chaos</li>
<li>💥 Making things useful, not just clear</li>
<li>💥 Noticing the gaps others skip past</li>
<li>💥 Holding the big picture without losing the details</li>
</ul>
<p>These weren’t skills I picked up from a course.
They came from years of working, observing, learning, and adapting.</p>
<p>In my previous role, for example, I used those strengths to stay aware of what was happening within the company, quickly finding the right information to help colleagues move forward.</p>
<p>So, I might look like a “junior” on paper,
but I’m definitely not a blank slate.</p>
<p>Career switching isn’t like pressing reset.
It’s catching a new wind in your sails, but the instincts come with you.</p>
<p>🚀 If you’re switching careers, remember: you’re not starting from scratch.
And don’t forget your superpowers!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>🧭 I didn’t know where I was going, just that I had to go.</p>
<p>About four years ago, I quit my job and made a big career change.</p>
<p>In those four years, I’ve learned a lot.</p>
<p>I’ve discovered more about myself: who I am, what I enjoy, and the kind of work that brings me energy and purpose.</p>
<p>I started by studying web development and exploring a range of technologies and tools.</p>
<p>Along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>🔍 I strengthened my research skills</li>
<li>🧠 I realised I have the ability to understand complex systems</li>
<li>🧩 I found that I really enjoy making sense of technical information</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in tech support led me into technical writing, which turned out to be the perfect fit, combining communication, curiosity and technology in a way that really suits me.</p>
<p>One of the things that drew me to working in tech in the first place is how quickly things evolve.
As a writer, I’m constantly learning — keeping up with new tools and systems, deepening my understanding, and translating it all for people who might be seeing it for the first time.</p>
<p>I genuinely enjoy that kind of ongoing learning.</p>
<p>Looking back on these years of transition, and the moment I took that first step into the unknown, I’d definitely make the same choice again!</p>
<p>👉 Have you made a career change, or are you thinking about it?
What have you learned through the process?</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>⏳ Given the amount of time we spend at work, it's no surprise that many people seek increased fulfilment in their professional lives by changing careers.</p>
<p>My own transition into web development has been a transformative and enriching experience, so I’d say this quote sums up my career change journey pretty well.</p>
<p>Here’s a very quick insight into what I’ve been learning and how I’ve grown in the process:</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Existing Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>💡 Adaptability</li>
<li>💡 Open-mindedness</li>
<li>💡 Resilience</li>
<li>💡 Creativity</li>
<li>💡 Problem solving</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developing New Skills</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>🌱 Analytical thinking</li>
<li>🌱 Curiosity</li>
<li>🌱 Innovation</li>
<li>🌱 Leadership</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expanding Horizons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>🌟 Continuous learning</li>
<li>🌟 Personal growth</li>
<li>🌟 Increased intellectual stimulation</li>
<li>🌟 Enriching experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, changing careers hasn’t only helped me gain technical skills, it’s also prepared me to face future challenges with confidence and determination. I’m excited to keep learning and growing in this dynamic field.</p>
