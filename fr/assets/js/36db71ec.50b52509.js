But your support team is drowning in tickets, and your documentation is either non-existent or a mess of scattered pages.\\n\\nLet\u2019s look at why your documentation isn\u2019t scaling as fast as your business. \x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\nThere are four common ways your docs are failing. I\'ll walk you through each problem, show you what kind of documentation actually scales with your growth, and provide an action plan you can start implementing this week.\\n\\n## The snowball effect\\n\\nMaybe you\u2019re familiar with this scenario?\\n\\n* Your support team is overwhelmed.  \\n* Your first contact resolution rate is plummeting.  \\n* Your users are frustrated and impatient.  \\n* Everything feels like it\u2019s spiralling out of control.\\n\\nIt\u2019s not just external. Internally, your team is struggling too. Developers are constantly interrupted by repeated questions, onboarding new hires takes weeks instead of days, and knowledge is locked away in your employees\u2019 heads, unshared.\\n\\nOn top of all this chaos, each ticket is costing you money to resolve. You\u2019re now wondering if you\u2019re able to increase the size of your support team, but user questions are multiplying faster than you can onboard new hires.\\n\\nDirect costs aren\'t your only concern either; poor support experiences drive churn. Your small support team can\'t be personally available for everyone all the time, but expectations are increasingly more demanding. A [2024 HubSpot report](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/state-of-service-report) reveals that 90% of customers expect an immediate response to their questions (within 10 minutes or less), while [Zendesk\u2019s most recent study](https://cxtrends.zendesk.com/#trend-2) shows that nearly three-quarters of consumers expect customer service to be available 24/7.\\n\\n[According to HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/statistics-on-customer-retention), 67% of customer churn is preventable by resolving issues during the first interaction. When your support team is overwhelmed, first-contact resolution suffers, and customers leave.\\n\\n## Self-Service: your 24/7 support team\\n\\nYour users can have access to 24/7 support without needing a round-the-clock support team. According to [Zendesk\'s 2023 report](https://www.zendesk.com/sg/blog/customer-service-and-lifetime-customer-value/%20), 98% of customers use self-service online resources, with 80% often consulting these options before contacting customer service. While there will always be users who need help, self-service documentation empowers them to find solutions on their own.\\n\\n[Buffer reduced support ticket volume](https://www.lotusthemes.com/blogs/best-help-centers/how-to-reduce-support-tickets-by-26-after-help-center-redesign-buffer-case-study) by using a Zendesk feature that suggests related help articles during the help request process. Redesigning their help centre reduced support tickets by 26%.\\n\\n## Just \u2018having documentation\u2019 isn\'t enough\\n\\nDocumentation reduces the need for direct human input, especially for repetitive and common questions. This gives your support team more time to focus on any previously undetected issues that come up. It\u2019s not just a case of \u2018having docs\u2019 though.\\n\\nHere are four common reasons documentation fails to deliver results and ways to prevent them:\\n\\n### Missing or incomplete content\\n\\nMissing information means that your users only have access to help through your employees, who are handling requests about every little detail. A common mistake is documenting only the standard flow or [happy path](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/happy-path). Missing potential issues or alternative user journeys can leave your users stuck when they encounter problems.\\n\\nThe reality is that your support team knows these details inside out; they just haven\u2019t been documented. A lack of maintenance workflows or an ownership system means that no one takes responsibility for updates. Or your team is too busy fighting fires to check the state of the documentation. Often, though, if your users can\u2019t find answers, they\u2019ll either contact support for help or just leave quietly for a product they understand better.\\n\\nIn contrast, including these cases in your help documentation enables and empowers your users to find answers quickly on their own. This also frees your team to focus on more complicated issues while improving customer satisfaction.\\n\\nHere are some useful questions to ask when checking for gaps in your docs:\\n\\n* **Focus** \u2013 Do your user guides answer real questions that your users are asking?\\n* **Error messages** \u2013 Do users understand why they received an error? Is a solution provided in the user interface (UI)?\\n* **Edge cases** \u2013 Are your docs written from the right perspective? Do they require prior knowledge? Not everyone fits in the same box. Users often use tools differently to how they are expected to, also known as [desire paths](https://thegood.com/insights/digital-desire-paths/).\\n\\n![A paved path turning left marked design and a well-worn path cutting a shortcut marked user experience.](./desire-path.jpg)\\n*Desire paths as a metaphor for user experience and design by Natalia Klishina*\\n\\n### Irrelevant content\\n\\nOn the other hand, too much information can cause confusion for your users, especially if not everything is useful. Maintaining documentation can take time, especially if it wasn\u2019t built for easy maintenance: no templates or standards, lack of ownership, multiple pages with conflicting information. Organising your docs with [information architecture (IA) best practices](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-information-architecture/#best-practices-for-information-architects) will help your users find the right content, and your team maintain it more easily.\\n\\nThis is also where knowing your audience is essential. User documentation needs to reach both beginners *and* expert users. Structuring your support content will help each user type find what they\u2019re looking for, whether skimming for a specific topic or reading word-for-word to gain a full understanding.\\n\\nCreating templates for your different documentation types enforces a set structure that guides your users. We naturally recognise patterns. When pages follow a consistent structure, our brain recognises how the elements are laid out. This eases the mental effort needed to process the information, helping us navigate faster.\\n\\nThink of it like an IKEA floor layout: there\u2019s a preset order with clear signage (and even arrows showing the expected flow\\\\!). Whether you\u2019re at your local store in Paris or visiting IKEA in Geneva, you know you\u2019ll easily find the kitchenware or bedroom furniture. In the same way, users will recognise the structure in your quick start guides or troubleshooting steps, helping them find their answers more easily.\\n\\nYou can use these points to check if your content is relevant to users:\\n\\n* **Search** \u2013 Can your users find the answers they need, or do they waste time searching? Your search tool may not be intuitive.\\n* **Structure** \u2013 Are your help pages structured? Does the navigation have a clear, consistent organisation for good usability?\\n* **Maintenance** \u2013 Who is responsible for updating documentation? Should this be assigned to an individual or a team?\\n\\n### Outdated content\\n\\nLet\u2019s be honest, things move quickly, and keeping documentation current is challenging. This is especially true during rapid product development.\\n\\nIntegrating good documentation practices from the start helps reduce the effort for documenting new products and features. When documentation evolves alongside innovation, it becomes more than an afterthought when support tickets start flooding in.\\n\\nThere are many techniques that help companies keep track of changes in their documentation. Here are some examples to get you started:\\n\\n* **Version control** \u2013 you don\u2019t need a complicated setup or tech skills to track versions. Confluence, Notion and Google Docs all allow you to view a history of changes.  \\n* **Ownership** \u2013 Assigning who is responsible for documentation maintenance prevents it from being forgotten by establishing clear accountability.\\n* **Workflow integration** \u2013 An ideal time to check that documentation matches the features is when developers update the code. You can use a docs checklist before deploying code updates to keep on top of changes and new feature docs.\\n* **Feedback loops** \u2013 Make updates based on recurring support tickets, social media, or customer feedback forms. User input is essential for understanding their pain points.\\n* **Review cycles** \u2013 Scheduling regular documentation reviews will help catch outdated content. Organise a timeline that fits with your team\u2019s availability and project needs.  \\n* **Docs culture** \u2013 Train all teams to make docs, not just one person or department. Provide tools like templates and guidance to encourage consistency.\\n\\n### Hidden content\\n\\nDocumentation that no one can find is documentation that no one can use. Do you know if your users can find the information they need? If your support team is fielding questions that are already answered somewhere in your knowledge base, then it\u2019s likely they simply can\u2019t find them.\\n\\nThere could be many reasons why your users struggle to find the right answers. Documentation links might be too subtle, for example just a help link in the footer, or buried under several layers of navigation. It could be that the help pages don\u2019t come up in the search because they aren\u2019t relevant to the users\u2019 search terms or are hidden behind a login or a paywall.\\n\\nHere\u2019s what you can do about this:\\n\\n* **Display prominently** \u2013 Make documentation findable when it\u2019s needed: clearly link help docs directly from your product or site. Check user access \\\\- do your docs require authentication or a subscription? Fix any broken links.\\n* **Structure logically** \u2013 Categorise your documentation based on user needs: quick start guides, how-to articles, troubleshooting pages, FAQs. Avoid fragmentation by keeping the same topics together.\\n* **Organise clearly** \u2013  Create intuitive navigation with clear labels, avoid nested pages, and keep menu levels to a minimum.\\n* **Enable search** \u2013 Being able to search makes a huge difference in helping users pinpoint the information they need faster. Add a search functionality that uses keywords your users actually use.\\n\\n## Types of documentation and when to use them\\n\\nNow we\u2019ve explored what makes good documentation, we\u2019ll look at the types of documentation that exist and how each can help support your users.\\n\\n### Knowledge Base\\n\\nThis is a searchable collection of self-service articles, centralised in one place with structured navigation. It encompasses the different types of customer-facing documentation, such as tutorials, FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and in-app help.\\n\\nA well-organised knowledge base directly addresses the problem of hidden content; everything users need is centralised and searchable.\\n\\n**Impact:** A knowledge base helps reduce support volume while improving SEO, or Google search visibility (if public, not gated behind a paywall).\\n\\n### Quick Start Guides\\n\\nOften the first point of call for most users, these pages contain sets of brief, minimal steps required for first-time setups and configuration. They are often used during free trial periods and product onboarding.\\n\\nThese guides fill a critical gap in missing content. For example, many users often wonder \u201dNow what?\u201d after signing up.\\n\\n**Impact:** These guides can help convert prospective users into paying customers by helping them onboard easily and see value quickly.\\n\\n### User Guides\\n\\nFrom general step-by-step to advanced feature instructions, user guides cover a range of different knowledge levels. They are typically characterised by simple, active language and task-focused steps. Visuals like product screenshots are often used to help users understand context.\\n\\nThe task-focused nature of user guides helps users avoid irrelevant information while providing key how-to details that are often missing.\\n\\n**Impact:** These guides are usually part of your users\u2019 self-service options, helping reduce support ticket volume. They can also help prevent churn by improving user experience.\\n\\n### Troubleshooting / FAQs\\n\\nThese problem-focused articles help users identify and solve issues quickly and independently. They often follow a set format, first presenting the problem, explaining briefly the cause and leading users in resolving this issue through logical steps. This is ideal for helping solve commonly recurring issues, which can be used before contacting support.\\n\\nThese docs document edge cases and errors, which are often missing in other formats. Using problem-first language also makes them easier for users to find.\\n\\n**Impact:** Fast, easy-access to problem resolutions improves both user experience and product reputation.\\n\\n## Taking action\\n\\nThis article covers many different aspects of documentation, which might feel overwhelming, especially if you\u2019re already swamped by support tickets. Just remember, you don\'t need to fix everything at once: start with just one problem and work from there. And if you don\u2019t have any documentation tools, don\u2019t let that stop you. Start with accessible tools for now, like Google Docs, Notion or Confluence, then migrate to dedicated software as you grow, if necessary.\\n\\nBelow is an example action plan to strategically implement improvements to your documentation:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 1 (1 week)\\n\\nIf you\u2019re not sure where to start, I find the best place is with your users. After all, the main aim of documentation is to improve user experience. Whether you use an Excel spreadsheet, a Jira board, or Zendesk, look through all of your customer support requests over the past 3-6 months.\\n\\n**Timeframe**  \\n**Small teams:** 1-2 hours skimming issues to spot repetition  \\n**Larger teams:** 4-6 hours for greater ticket volume\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 2 (1-2 weeks)\\n\\nCategorise common or recurring issues, whether they\u2019ve been resolved or not. This task should help you understand where your users tend to get stuck the most. Select up to three issues that are the most urgent (biggest impact for your users) or easiest to fix.\\n\\n**Timeframe**  \\nSmall teams: 2-3 hours for clear, focused docs\\nLarger teams: 5-8 hours, allowing for reviews and approval with company documentation standards\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Phase 3 (ongoing)\\n\\nMonitor the impact to see how your documentation helps users. Create feedback loops and track weekly ticket trends to see if the same issues are still raised after creating docs. Find the latest, most common questions. Continue making regular improvements based on the data.\\n\\n**Timeframe**  \\nSmall teams: 1-3 hours per month  \\nLarger teams: 3-6 hours per month\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Results\\n\\nWithin just a few weeks of updating or creating documentation for those first three recurring issues, you should see a noticeable drop in related tickets. You\u2019ll also find that issue resolutions are faster for these areas, and your team can benefit by referencing the docs instead of scouring through old tickets and emails for answers.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Improved support scaling through documentation\\n\\nPoor or non-existent documentation leads to higher user effort and confusion. These bad experiences lead to product abandonment and churn. Documentation is a key strategy to scaling your customer service options efficiently, while also improving user satisfaction.\\n\\nYou don\u2019t need fancy tools or a whole team dedicated to documentation. Now you\u2019re armed with a better understanding of what makes good documentation, various pitfalls to avoid, and an action plan for getting started.\\n\\nThis approach works for companies with the capacity to handle it internally. However, if your team is stretched too thin, bringing in outside help can speed up the process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Need Help With Your Documentation?\\n\\nIf your support team is drowning in tickets and your documentation isn\'t helping, it\u2019s fixable.\\n\\nI help SaaS companies reduce support volume through clear, user-focused documentation.\\n\\n**Reserve a discovery call** to discuss your documentation challenges and identify quick wins.\\n\\n[Book a Discovery Call](https://calendly.com/alison-combes/connect) | [View Services](/about/packages)"},{"id":"consistency-beats-perfection","metadata":{"permalink":"/fr/blog/consistency-beats-perfection","source":"@site/blog/2025-11-13-consistency.md","title":"Consistency Beats Perfection","description":"Discover why consistency matters more than perfection.
